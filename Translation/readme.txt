How translation works:
You have just to translate the part after colon ("tags": "Your Translation"). Special characters like \n might be used to indicate a new line. When your translation is done, make sure to create a 'pull request' so it can be merged to main branch. If you forget to do that step your translation won't be added to the main branch.
